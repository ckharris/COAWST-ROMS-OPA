** This module declares Lagrangian oil drifters                       **
** parameteres. They are usually read from the appropriate input      **
** script.                                                            **

** Note that all the *.h files are located in ROMS/Nonlinear/Oil      **
** and included within  <...>  to allow the user to customize any of  **
** them in the project directory  while keeping the distributed code  **
** intact (check the build script for details).                       **
